# Does this work? 

Hello new recruit! To get started read the comments of SAMSIM.f90, or look directly into documentation/Reference_manual.pdf, which was generated from the source code via doxygen. For questions contact Philipp Griewank (philipp.griewank@univie.ac.at), Niels Fuchs (niels.fuchs@uni-hamburg.de), or Dirk Notz (dirk.notz@uni-hamburg.de). Good luck!

If you are intersted in brightness temperatures, we highly recommend you look at the following project, which contains the code Clara Burgard created: https://github.com/ClimateClara/scripts_paper_arc3o_part1
